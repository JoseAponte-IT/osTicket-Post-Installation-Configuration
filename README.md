# Configuring osTicket: Departments, Roles, and Help Topics
This project demonstrates how to configure the osTicket ticketing system by setting up departments, agents, users, roles, permissions, and teams. Additionally, we streamline the ticketing process for both clients and support engineers by configuring help topics. This project showcases a foundational understanding of ticketing systems along with technical proficiency in system configuration, role management, and ticketing system optimization. ü´°

<h1>osTicket: Post-Installation Configuration</h1>


<h2>Tools & Technology Used</h2>

- osTicket: A widely-used open-source ticketing system for customer support.
- Microsoft Azure: Cloud platform for hosting the Windows 10 virtual machine.
- Windows 10 VM: Virtual environment used for hosting and configuring the ticketing system.
- RDP: Remote Desktop Protocol for securely accessing the Azure-hosted VM.

<h2>Key Objectives:</h2>

- Role-Based Configuration: Define and assign roles, permissions, and teams within osTicket, ensuring proper access and     workflow management.
- Department Setup: Organize support operations by creating and configuring departments to handle specific ticket         categories.
- User and Agent Management: Configure user profiles and assign agents to teams to streamline task delegation and         collaboration.
- Help Topics Optimization: Create help topics to simplify the ticket submission process for clients and improve         efficiency for support engineers.
- Remote Access: Use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to securely access and manage the VM.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

- Completed the previous lab: osTicket: Prerequisites and Installation
- Microsoft RDP: If on MAC go to APP Store and download Microsoft RDP

# üéâCongratulations

 OsTicket is up and running and fully configured for use üåù. In the next lab we will create tickets and resolve them as a support engineer. Familarizing ourselves with ticket life cycles, SLA, and GOOD 'OL TROUBLESHOOTINGü§ì.

<h2>We Have Successfully:</h2>

- Configured a ticketing system by setting up departments, agents, users, roles, permissions, and teams.

- Streamlined the ticket process for both clients and support engineers by creating help topics.

- Hosted and managed the ticketing system using a Microsoft Azure Windows 10 Virtual Machine.

- Accessed the Virtual Machine securely through RDP for seamless configuration and management.

# That Concludes this lab<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"/>

In the next and last lab we will learn about ticket lifecycles and how to troubleshoot tickets correctly.
